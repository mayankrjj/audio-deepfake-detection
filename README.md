​Based on the Audio-Deepfake-Detection repository and recent literature, here are three promising approaches for detecting AI-generated human speech, considering real-time detection potential and applicability to real conversations:​

Contrastive Learning-based Audio Deepfake Detector (CLAD)

Key Technical Innovation: CLAD employs contrastive learning to enhance robustness against audio manipulations, such as volume control, fading, and noise injection, which can otherwise bypass detection systems. It focuses on minimizing variations introduced by these manipulations, thereby improving detection accuracy.​

Potential Limitations or Challenges: Implementing contrastive learning requires careful selection of positive and negative samples, and the approach may demand substantial computational resources during training.​

Deep Learning Models Utilizing Spectrogram-Based Features

Key Technical Innovation: This approach transforms audio inputs into spectrograms using methods like Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), Constant-Q Transform (CQT), and Wavelet Transform (WT). These spectrograms are then processed using deep learning models to detect deepfake audio.​
arXiv

Reported Performance Metrics: Specific metrics vary across studies, but the use of spectrogram-based features has shown improved detection accuracy in various experiments.​

Why Promising: Spectrograms provide a visual representation of audio signals, capturing both temporal and frequency information, which is beneficial for distinguishing between genuine and fake audio.​

Potential Limitations or Challenges: The effectiveness can depend on the choice of transformation method and the quality of the spectrograms. Additionally, processing spectrograms may introduce latency, impacting real-time detection capabilities.​

Explainable AI (XAI) Methods for Deepfake Audio Detection

Key Technical Innovation: This approach integrates advanced neural network architectures like VGG16, MobileNet, ResNet, and custom CNNs with explainable AI methods such as LIME, Grad-CAM, and SHAP. These methods enhance detection accuracy and provide insights into model predictions.​

Reported Performance Metrics: While specific metrics are not detailed, the incorporation of XAI methods has been shown to improve detection accuracy and provide interpretability to the model's decisions.​

Why Promising: Combining powerful neural network architectures with XAI methods not only enhances detection performance but also offers transparency, which is crucial for understanding and trusting the model's decisions in real-world applications.​

Potential Limitations or Challenges: Implementing XAI methods can be complex and may require additional computational resources. Moreover, the interpretability provided by XAI methods needs to be effectively communicated to end-users to be truly beneficial.​
